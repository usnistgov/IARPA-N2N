\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Overview}
The Nail to Nail (N2N) Fingerprint Capture Challenge aims to improve live
and forensic biometric fingerprint recognition by improving N2N fingerprint
enrollment capture technology while eliminating the human operator.
Participants will provide new \scanners capable of meeting these requirements.
The images captured by these devices will be fed to a state-of-the-art
commercial fingerprint template generation and fingerprint template
identification algorithms in order to assess performance. Alternatively,
participants may submit their own algorithms, provided they adhere to this
Application Program Interface (API) and test plan.

This document aims to clarify technical details regarding the API, as well as
defining methods on how to submit an API implementation.

\subsection{Timeline}
\label{subsec:intro-timeline}
All API implementation participants must adhere to the timeline below.
Additional timelines apply to the submission of information for other portions
of the project. All deadlines are available on \theprojectwebsite.
